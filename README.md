🧪 E-Commerce API Testing with Postman – Swagger Petstore
This project demonstrates manual API testing of the Swagger Petstore sample APIs using Postman.
It covers User, Pet, and Order APIs with essential smoke tests, negative cases, and a traceability matrix (RTM).

📌 Project Overview
•Objective: Validate Swagger Petstore APIs (User, Pet, Order modules).
•Scope: Perform CRUD operations, authentication checks, and input validation.
•Tools Used:
    •Postman : for API execution.
    •JSON collections : for one-click execution.
    •Excel Test Case and RTM : for test coverage.

✅ Included Smoke Tests
User APIs
•Create User
•Login User
•Get User by Username
•Logout User
  
Pet APIs
•Add Pet
•Get Pet by ID
•Update Pet
•Delete Pet

Order APIs
•Place Order
•Get Order by ID
•Delete Order

📝 Pre-written Tests
Each request validates:
✅ Status code (200, 4xx)
✅ Response format (JSON)
✅ Key fields exist (username, petId, orderId)

🧪 Negative Test Scenarios
•Create user with missing username → expect 4xx (currently returns 200 → defect).
•Add pet with invalid status → expect 4xx.
•Place order with negative quantity → expect 4xx.
•Get non-existing user → expect 404.
•Logout without login → expect 401 (but returns 200 → defect).
